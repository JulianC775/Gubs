# Gubs: A Game of Wit and Luck - Official Rules

## Game Overview
- **Players**: 2-6 players
- **Age**: 10 and up
- **Duration**: Approximately 20 minutes
- **Deck**: 70 cards total

## Objective
Be the player with the most **Free and/or Protected Gubs** in play when the final letter of the word G-U-B has been drawn from the deck.

## Setup

1. **Initial Gubs**: Remove one Gub card per player from the deck. Each player places one Gub face-up in front of them to start their colony.

2. **Letter Card Placement**:
   - Remove the three Letter cards (G, U, B) from the deck
   - Shuffle the remaining deck thoroughly
   - Insert the Letter cards back into the deck:
     - One near the top (roughly first third)
     - One in the middle (roughly second third)
     - One near the bottom (roughly final third)

3. **Deal Starting Hands**:
   - Deal 3 cards to each player
   - If any Event cards are dealt, place them randomly back into the deck and deal replacement cards
   - Each player's hand is kept secret

4. **Play Area Setup**:
   - Place the deck face-down in the center
   - Designate a discard pile area nearby

## Turn Structure

Players take turns in clockwise order. Each turn consists of:

### 1. Draw Phase
- Draw one card from the deck (optional, but you cannot skip two consecutive turns)
- **If you draw an Event card**:
  - Its effect is immediately played
  - Exception: Letter cards (G, U, B) are placed to the side face-up for everyone to see
  - Other Event cards go to the discard pile after resolving

### 2. Play Phase
- Play any number of cards from your hand
- Follow the instructions on each card's text
- Cards can be played in any order of your choice

### 3. Discard Phase
- If you have more than 8 cards in hand at the end of your turn, discard down to 8 cards

## Card Types

### 1. Gubs (Scoring Cards)
- Enter play face-up in front of their owner
- All Gubs start **unprotected** (Free)
- Only Free and Protected Gubs count for scoring
- Gubs in hand or under Traps do NOT count for scoring

#### Special Gub: Esteemed Elder
- Immune to all cards except Lightning
- Cannot be protected by Barricades
- Cannot be recovered via Age-Old Cure

### 2. Barricades (Protection Cards)
Examples: Mushroom, Toad Rider
- Placed on top of Gubs to make them "Protected"
- Protected Gubs are safe from most Hazards and Traps
- A Gub can have multiple Barricades stacked on it

### 3. Traps
Examples: Sud Spout, Spear
- Placed over opponent's Gubs
- Trapped Gubs remain in play but do NOT count for scoring
- Traps stay on Gubs until destroyed or removed
- When a Trap is destroyed, the Gub becomes Free (stays with original owner unless card specifies otherwise)

### 4. Tools (Help Cards)
These cards benefit your colony:
- **Age-Old Cure**: Rescue cards from discard pile
- **Retreat**: Retrieve all your in-play cards (including those played by opponents) back to your hand for replaying
- **Rings**: Transfer a freed Gub to your colony
- Discarded after use

### 5. Hazards (Attack Cards)
These cards attack opponents or steal:
- **Spear**: Destroy Barricades or trap Gubs
- **Lightning**: Only card that can destroy Esteemed Elder
- **Smahl Thief**: Steal an opponent's Gub (if stealing from under Sud Spout, the Spout is discarded)
- **Gargok Plague**: Forces opponent to shuffle their hand back into deck and draw new cards (can be prevented by discarding Age-Old Cure)
- Discarded after use

### 6. Interrupts
- **Cricket Song**: Wild card that can represent any Hazard, Tool, or Interrupt (cannot represent Event, Gub, Barricade, or Trap cards). Discarded immediately.
- **Flop Boat**: Redirect Event cards back into the deck before effects resolve (works even on Letter cards!)

### 7. Event Cards
- **Letter Cards (G, U, B)**: Placed to the side when drawn. Game ends when all three are revealed.
- **Flash Flood**: All players discard all unprotected (naked) Gubs
- Other Event cards trigger immediate effects

## Special Rules

### Card Playing
- You may play as many cards as you can during your turn
- The only cards that MUST be played immediately are Event cards when drawn
- Gubs can be strategically held in hand

### Hand Limit
- Maximum 8 cards at the end of your turn
- No limit during your turn while playing cards

### Skip Turns
- You may choose not to draw a card
- You cannot skip drawing two consecutive turns

### Card Interactions
- **Spear destroying Sud Spout**: The Gub becomes Free but stays with the original owner
- **Rings**: Only Rings can transfer a freed Gub to the liberating player
- **Retreat**: Allows complete reorganization of your colony

## Winning the Game

### Game End Trigger
The game ends **immediately** when the third Letter card (completing G-U-B) is drawn from the deck.

### Scoring
Count only:
- **Free Gubs** (unprotected Gubs in play)
- **Protected Gubs** (Gubs with Barricades in play)

Do NOT count:
- Trapped Gubs
- Gubs in your hand
- Discarded Gubs

### Winner
The player with the **highest total** of Free and Protected Gubs wins.

### Tiebreakers
If players are tied:
1. Player with the **Esteemed Elder** wins
2. If still tied, player with **fewest cards in hand** wins

## Strategy Tips

- Protect your Gubs early with Barricades
- Timing is crucial - don't reveal all your Gubs too early
- Use Retreat strategically to reorganize before the game ends
- Watch for Letter cards to gauge how much time remains
- Keep your hand size manageable while holding key cards
- The Esteemed Elder is powerful but cannot be protected normally

## Quick Reference

### Turn Summary
1. Draw 1 card (optional, can't skip twice)
2. Play any number of cards
3. Discard to 8 cards if needed

### Scoring Formula
**Free Gubs + Protected Gubs = Your Score**

(Trapped Gubs and hand cards don't count!)
